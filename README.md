# PGP-AIML-Study-sessions
Various notebooks from our study sessions in PGP AIML from UT Austin

The deep learning study sessions (all hosted in 2021) have the study session recordings uploaded to youtube for reference. The notebooks in the ML-sessions folder do not, these notebooks won't make a lot of sense outside the context of those study groups, but are left intacted for reference by group members. 

If you have any questions feel free to message me.
