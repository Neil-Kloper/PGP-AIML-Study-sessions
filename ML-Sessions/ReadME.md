The notebooks here are from the study sessions before we started on deep learning. These files don't have study session recordings associated with them and all relevent notes are contained in the notebooks themselves.

#### Session 1
basic loops and control flow

#### Session 2
More fun with loops and practice with applying nested loops

#### Session 3
Loading data and running notebooks in a google colab session (notebook written and run on an Iphone 7)

#### Files_test
Another instance of walking a few students through different methods of loading data in Goggle Colab (uploading data to session, using sample data, and loading data directly from one's google drive).

#### house-predict-basic.ipynb
This notebook is related to how to save the predictions of a model and submit those predictions to a competition

#### house-price-prediction-with-decision-trees.ipynb 
A basic notebook on how to impute data, label encode, and fit a model to it
